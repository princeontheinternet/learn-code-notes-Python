# Testing

* **Testing** is a process of finding out if there are bugs in your code.

* We should consider testing one code with data that meets the following criteria:

  1. Outlying values at both the low and high ends. *(Edge Cases)*
  2. Outlying values at the low end only.
  3. Outlying values at the high end only.
  4. No outlying values. *(No high or low values i.e. all valid values)*
  5. Only Outlying values. *(All invald values)*
  6. An empty set of data.

## Debugging

* **Debugging** is the process of working out what the bugs are, and fixing them.
* Testing and debugging go together.
* Writing functions in program makes it easier to test and debug as functions are small self-contained bits of code, that're easy to test and debug.

* **Grace Hopper** is famous for coining the term "debugging" and discovering the 1st computer bug.
  
* While working on the Harvard Mark II computer, she found a moth inside the machine causing an error, which she removed and docuented. This incident is considered as the first recorded computer bug.
