# Python Introduction

1. It's named after the cult comedy show **"Monty Python's Flying Circus"**.

2. It was created by **"Guido Van Rossum"** and released in **1991**. (*Guido is pronounced as "Geeudo"*)

3. Python is easy to use.
   
3. Python is an **object-oriented, interpreted, and a high level language**.

        1. The truth is: Python is both an interpreted and a compiled language. But calling Python a compiled language would be misleading.
   
        2. When you run the program using:
            $ python filename.py
            Python code is translated into intermediate code (byte code: lower-level and platform-independent representation of your source code) using compiler internally,
            and filename.pyc is generated,
            which has to be interpreted by a virtual machine, known as the PVM, the Python Virtual Machine,
            and then the o/p is displayed.
            
            # Note: All this is done internally by Python.
   
        3. Because of PVM, python is also protable.
