# Documentation in Python

* Documenting your function and classes makes it easier for other people to use.
* Documentation will help you to understand your code, when you come to modify it later.
* If you write the documentation for your functions, before you write the code, you'll have a clear idea of what the function's going to do.
  
      You can press Ctrl+Q to see the document or click the function while holding Ctrl button.
      You can also see the doc using:
  
        help(print)
        print(print.__doc__)
