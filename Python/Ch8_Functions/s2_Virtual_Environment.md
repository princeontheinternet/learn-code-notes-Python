# Virtual Environment

* A Python virtual environment is an isolated installation of Python, separate from your main installation.
  
* To activate the environment in terminal:
  
      $ source venv/python3.6/bin/activate

* You no longer have to run python3, whichever version you have installed in the virtual environment you run them all with the command python.
  
* To deactivate:
  
      $ deactivate
